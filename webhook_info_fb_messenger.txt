**** clinc_webhook information ****

Setting up webhook
1.Activate virtual environment 
2.Setup flask server using following commands:
    a.pip install -r requirements.txt
    b.export FLASK_DEBUG=True
    c.export FLASK_APP=app
    d.flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
3.Setup ngrok server using "ngrok http <port_number>""
4.In fb developer site(found in facebook_developer_info.txt), navigate to messenger settings in left side, and paste "<ngrok_server_url>" in webhook section, and VERIFY_TOKEN (5941526563) in app.py 
5.Go to messenger settings in sidebar, subscribe webhook to page, then get access token and paste into code.  You may need to edit permissions as well (checkbox everything)


****Important info****
1. If your code is buggy, and you try to send a message through facebook to the al-i page, then the request will fail, and you might have to wait a longass time before you can send another message
successfully, so make sure to use CURL first to test the webhook locally, then once it has no bugs, try it through messenger
	.CURL Example found below:
		.curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"object":"page","entry":[{"id":43674671559,"time":1460620433256,"messaging":[{"send89},"recipient":{"id":987654321},"timestamp":1460620433123,"message":{"mid":"mid.1460620432888:f8e3412003d2d1cd93","seq":12604,"text":"Testing Chat Bot .."}}]}]}'  <ngrok_url>
